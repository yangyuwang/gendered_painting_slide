	abstract = {Each year, people spend less time reading and more time viewing images1, which are proliferating online2–4. Images from platforms such as Google and Wikipedia are downloaded by millions every day2,5,6, and millions more are interacting through social media, such as Instagram and {TikTok}, that primarily consist of exchanging visual content. In parallel, news agencies and digital advertisers are increasingly capturing attention online through the use of images7,8, which people process more quickly, implicitly and memorably than text9–12. Here we show that the rise of images online significantly exacerbates gender bias, both in its statistical prevalence and its psychological impact. We examine the gender associations of 3,495 social categories (such as ‘nurse’ or ‘banker’) in more than one million images from Google, Wikipedia and Internet Movie Database ({IMDb}), and in billions of words from these platforms. We find that gender bias is consistently more prevalent in images than text for both female- and male-typed categories. We also show that the documented underrepresentation of women online13–18 is substantially worse in images than in text, public opinion and {US} census data. Finally, we conducted a nationally representative, preregistered experiment that shows that googling for images rather than textual descriptions of occupations amplifies gender bias in participants’ beliefs. Addressing the societal effect of this large-scale shift towards visual communication will be essential for developing a fair and inclusive future for the internet.},

Using experiments, the research found that images would have higher chance to introduce gender stereotype than texts.
Relevance to my study: While the study investigates contemporary media, its relevance lies in the methodological and conceptual assertion that visual forms (more than text) encode and transmit gender biases. This supports the central claim of my research—that visual cultural products like paintings would be influenced by societal gender structures and perpetuate them, even more than the texts-ish cultural products.},

We use computational tools to characterize representation in children’s books widely read in homes, classrooms, and libraries over the past century and describe economic forces that may contribute to these patterns. We introduce new artificial intelligence methods for systematically converting images into data. We apply these tools, alongside text analysis methods, to measure skin color, race, gender, and age in the content of these books, documenting what has changed and what has endured over time. We find underrepresentation of Black and Latinx people in the most influential books, relative to their population shares, though representation of Black individuals increases over time. Females are also increasingly present but appear less often in text than in images, suggesting greater symbolic inclusion in pictures than substantive inclusion in stories. Characters in these influential books have lighter average skin color than in other books, even after conditioning on race, and children are depicted with lighter skin color than adults on average. We present empirical analysis of related economic behavior to better understand the representation we find in these books. On the demand side, we show that people consume books that center their own identities and that the types of children’s books purchased correlate with local political beliefs. On the supply side, we document higher prices for books that center nondominant social identities and fewer copies of these books in libraries that serve predominantly White communities.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and computer vision have been applied for image recognition of art objects such as paintings, sculpture images etc. In particular, deep learning methods for image classiﬁcation in art have been used to improve user engagement by providing access to accurately labelled and classiﬁed art objects. As an increasing number of notable museums turn towards creating open access collections, alternatives to the use of laborious human annotating methods are needed. This paper focuses on the Open Access initiative of The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) which was launched in 2017 in an effort to expand The Met’s reach and presence. The museum now provides a select dataset of information on more than 470,000 artworks in its collection for unrestricted commercial and noncommercial use. However, with a widely accessible collection, the Met now faces the problem of how to enhance the user experience via access to accurately labelled art. This paper focuses on machine learning methods with applicability to automated classiﬁcation of images obtained from The Met’s online collection. We aimed to: 1) Compare three different convolutional neural networks {ResNet} 50, {ResNet} 101, and Inception-{ResNet}-V2- using human annotated data, 2) Add transparency and interpretability to our models by using Gradient Weighted Class Activation Maps ({GRAD}-cams) and to explore bias in gender labels and 3) implement a multi-label classiﬁcation model using {ResNet} 50. Future work would include the use of unsupervised clustering methods / auto-encoders to explore additional themes in the data. Other extensions of this work would include exploring methods to implement ﬁne grained visual categorization, to mitigate bias, and to address the limitations associated with culture and stylistic interpretations. Deep learning techniques for art image classiﬁcation may also help detect consistent features of bias in human annotated art.},

Regression analyses revealed that depicted sexuality and sexual objectification did not change during the period studied. However, ambiguous sexual expression, including sexual gestures, sexual poses, and sexual facial expressions, did increase over time. Furthermore, female music artists were more often portrayed as sexually objectified than male artists. Male artists were more likely shown to objectify other individuals compared with female artists. Moreover, Black and non-White artists were more often shown presenting ambiguous sexual expression than White/Caucasian artists. No significant differences occurred when comparing music videos from the R\&B/hip-hop/rap genres with music videos from the pop genre. Our findings are discussed in the light of objectification theory and social–cognitive theory leading to suggestions for future research.

	abstract = {Images in children’s books convey messages about society and the roles that people play in it. Understanding these messages requires systematic measurement of who is represented. Computer vision face detection tools can provide such measurements; however, state-of-the-art face detection models were trained with photographs, and 80\% of images in children’s books are illustrated; thus existing methods both misclassify and miss classifying many faces. In this paper, we introduce a new approach to analyze images using {AI} tools, resulting in data that can assess representation of race, gender, and age in both illustrations and photographs in children’s books. We make four primary contributions to the fields of deep learning and social sciences: (1) We curate an original face detection data set ({IllusFace} 1.0) by manually labeling 5,403 illustrated faces with bounding boxes. (2) We train two {AutoML}-based face detection models for illustrations: (i) using {IllusFace} 1.0 ({FDAI}); (ii) using {iCartoon}, a publicly available data set ({FDAI} {iC}), each optimized for illustrated images, detecting 2.5 times more faces in our testing data than the established face detector using Google Vision ({FDGV}). (3) We curate a data set of the race, gender, and age of 980 faces manually labeled by three different raters ({CBFeatures} 1.0). (4) We train an {AutoML} feature classification model ({FCA}) using {CBFeatures} 1.0. We compare {FCA} with the performance of another {AutoML} model that we trained on {UTKFace}, a public data set ({FCA} {UTK}) and of an established model using {FairFace} ({FCF}). Finally, we examine distributions of character identities over the last century across the models. We find that {FCA} is 34\% more accurate than {FCF} in its race predictions. These contributions provide tools to educators, caregivers, and curriculum developers to assess the representation contained in children’s content.},

Their models ({FDAI} and {FCA}) significantly outperform prior models, detecting more faces and improving classification accuracy, especially for racial identification.
    Application to my research: This is a crucial methodological precedent. The pipeline from detection to classification is directly adaptable to paintings, where the visual style varies significantly from real-world photography. The model here could be one of my choices to detect patterns in gender representations in paintings. Compared to {HyperFace}, this is more suitable for painting data. However, the model did not consist of facial orientation detection, so I might need to add functions to it as well.},

The results provide a nuanced picture of change and persistence in stereotypes across 200 y. Change was observed in the top-associated words and traits: Whether analyzing the top 10 or 50 associates, at least 50\% of top associates changed across successive decades. Despite this changing content of top-associated words, the average valence (positivity/negativity) of these top stereotypes was generally persistent. Ultimately, through advances in the availability of historical word embeddings, this study offers a comprehensive characterization of both change and persistence in social group representations as revealed through books of the English-speaking world from 1800 to 1999.},

Updating Goffman’s classic study of Gender Advertisements, we study the intersections of gender, professional role, country and time in media representation. Thus, we combine and confront quantitative content analysis with insights from critical gender studies on polysemy and intersectionality. Analyzing a sample of 5840 images from mainstream, commercial and high fashion magazines published in 1982, 1996 and 2011, we find that gender representation strongly intersects with time, place, and notably: professional role. Models, who represent the specific ‘aesthetic capital’ of the fashion field, are portrayed in highly specific ways. Over time, gender differences in representation become stronger in Italy, while in the Netherlands male and female representation converges towards conventionally ‘feminine’ styles. In both countries, we find increasing prominence of (North-American) Goffmanian gender conventions and a new ‘withdrawn’ gendered style emerging in the early 2000s. This new style employs new signs and conventions to denote gender and professional status: it separates men from women, and models from non-models. Our analysis shows, first, that gender representation does not directly reflect gender inequality. Second, it demonstrates the impact of globalization on gender representation. Third, it highlights the polysemy and cultural specificity of visual signs: gender difference can be ‘ritualized’ and ‘stylized’ in various ways. These diverse gendered conventions intersect with other characteristics, and may convey diverse, and changing messages about the relation between gender and sexuality, power, aesthetics and (visual) pleasure.},

Focusing on the Montias Database of 17th Century Art Inventories, this article turns a critical eye toward digitized art-historical data that is collected, preserved, and organized by cultural heritage institutions. Using the digital art history project “Beyond ‘Exceptional’: Reassessing Women’s Participation in the Cultural Sphere of Seventeenth-Century Amsterdam with Digital Social Network Analysis,” I demonstrate the potential of computational methods for mediating the biases inherent to these collections.},

The study constructs a network graph of over 2,200 nodes, identifying women as key cultural agents who were previously obscured due to male-centric cataloging. Also, the study visualizes how individuals like Catharina van der Voort acted as central hubs within art and collecting networks, challenging the assumed invisibility of women in historical art economies.
Relevance to my research: This study provides a concrete model for applying network centrality to historical artistic contexts, validating the use of {SNA} methods in uncovering gendered dynamics. It reinforces my approach of measuring artists’ structural power via social centrality and linking this to their visual representation of gender in art.
Research gap: This paper did not pay attention to the cultural productions, while only focused on the network phenomenon. My research would like to extend the approach to explore how centrality and centralization would influence the real cultural productions.},

Relationship between structure and gender representation: Despite the main idea that gender is constructed, an inner idea of Butler is that the gender performance itself is constructed by social structures.

I seek to establish links between dynamics of the arts domains and the fostering of specific modes of engagement with them – and, potentially, stances in other domains of life. I argue that a return to Adorno’s notion of (musical) material allows for such connections to be made: the ‘material’ is where the dynamics of the specific arts domains are inscribed; but it is also what is engaged with – by composers and artists as well as by interpreters, performers and publics. A dialectical material lens seems well suited for the critical study of the dynamic of arts domains in the 20th and 21st centuries, given the multiple artistic ‘breaks’ proclaimed. Focusing on some well-known movements in music and cuisine which sought to ‘emancipate’, ‘democratise’, and ‘diversify’ sounds and flavours, I analyse the processes through which they produced sound and flavour anew. I suggest that sounds and flavours themselves have become the carriers of logics relevant to music and cuisine, and that they have come to imperiously command modes of commitment (from composers and chefs, performers, listeners and diners alike) that evince specific stances. Through this necessarily sketchy survey, I provide indications that broader, cross-cutting cultural dynamics may be at stake. Overall, I seek to make clear what theoretical steps are afforded by the joint attention to materiality and the dynamic of art domains.},

Gender is different from other forms of social inequality in that men and women interact extensively within families and households and in other role relations. This high rate of contact between men and women raises important questions about how interaction creates experiences that confirm, or potentially could undermine, the beliefs about gender difference and inequality that underlie the gender system. Any theory of gender difference and inequality must accommodate three basic findings from research on interaction. (a). People perceive gender differences to be pervasive in interaction. (b). Studies of interaction among peers with equal power and status show few gender differences in behavior. (c). Most interactions between men and women occur in the structural context of roles or status relationships that are unequal. These status and power differences create very real interaction effects, which are often confounded with gender. Beliefs about gender difference combine with structurally unequal relationships to perpetuate status beliefs, leading men and women to recreate the gender system in everyday interaction. Only peer interactions that are not driven by cultural beliefs about the general competence of men and women or interactions in which women are status- or power-advantaged over men are likely to undermine the gender system.},

This paper presents a robust single-stage face detector, named {RetinaFace}, which performs pixel-wise face localisation on various scales of faces by taking advantages of joint extra-supervised and self-supervised multi-task learning. Specifically, We make contributions in the following five aspects: (1) We manually annotate five facial landmarks on the {WIDER} {FACE} dataset and observe significant improvement in hard face detection with the assistance of this extra supervision signal. (2) We further add a self-supervised mesh decoder branch for predicting a pixel-wise 3D shape face information in parallel with the existing supervised branches. (3) On the {WIDER} {FACE} hard test set, {RetinaFace} outperforms the state of the art average precision ({AP}) by 1.1\% (achieving {AP} equal to 91.4\%). (4) On the {IJB}-C test set, {RetinaFace} enables state of the art methods ({ArcFace}) to improve their results in face verification ({TAR}=89.59\% for {FAR}=1e-6). (5) By employing light-weight backbone networks, {RetinaFace} can run real-time on a single {CPU} core for a {VGA}-resolution image.

We revisit both the alignment step and the representation step by employing explicit 3D face modeling in order to apply a piecewise affine transformation, and derive a face representation from a nine-layer deep neural network. This deep network involves more than 120 million parameters using several locally connected layers without weight sharing, rather than the standard convolutional layers. Thus we trained it on the largest facial dataset to-date, an identity labeled dataset of four million facial images belonging to more than 4, 000 identities. The learned representations coupling the accurate model-based alignment with the large facial database generalize remarkably well to faces in unconstrained environments, even with a simple classifier. Our method reaches an accuracy of 97.35\% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild ({LFW}) dataset, reducing the error of the current state of the art by more than 27\%, closely approaching human-level performance.},

	abstract = {Has human beauty always been perceived in the same manner? We used a set of 120,000 paintings from different periods to analyze human faces between the 13th and the 20th centuries in order to establish whether there has been a single canon of beauty (that would maximize reproduction probabilities) or whether this has changed over time. Our study shows that when measuring averageness, symmetry, and orientation, the representation of human faces has not remained constant and that there are substantial differences between the faces depicted between the 15th and 18th centuries when compared to those of both the 13th and 20th centuries. Especially significant is the decrease in the perceived beauty of faces in 20th-century paintings, as the freedom of artists and the openness of society fostered the representation of different types of human faces other than that of classical styles.To this article supplementary material can be found at {HeiDATA} Dataverse Networkhttp://dx.doi.org/10.11588/data/10057Figures S1-5Tables S1-5External Database S1.

	abstract = {This paper provides a framework for understanding the ways in which social processes produce social inequality. Specifically, we focus on a particular type of social process that has received limited attention in the literature and in which inter-subjective meaning-making is central: cultural processes. Much of the literature on inequality has focused on the actions of dominant actors and institutions in gaining access to material and non-material resources, or on how ecological effects cause unequal access to material resources. In contrast, we focus on processes that contribute to the production (and reproduction) of inequality through the routine and taken-for-granted actions of both dominant and subordinate actors. We highlight two types of cultural processes: identification and rationalization. We describe and illustrate four processes that we consider to be significant analytical exemplars of these two types of cultural processes: racialization and stigmatization (for identification) and standardization and evaluation (for rationalization). We argue that attention to such cultural processes is critical and complementary to current explanations of social inequality.},

In a recent article in Comparative Politics, Seligson argued that the strong aggregate-level correlations Inglehart found between political culture and stable democracy were spurious because there are no individual-level correlations between political culture and overt support for democracy. Seligson's analysis exemplifies the sort of cross-level fallacy he attributes to Inglehart: he equates individual-level support for democracy with the presence of democratic institutions. However, individual-level support of democracy is only weakly linked with societal-level democracy. Democracy currently has a positive image almost everywhere, but favorable opinions are often superficial. Unless they are accompanied by more deeply rooted orientations of tolerance, trust, and participation, chances for effective democracy are poor.},

	abstract = {Using Panel Study of Income Dynamics ({PSID}) microdata over the 1980-2010 period, we provide new empirical evidence on the extent of and trends in the gender wage gap, which declined considerably during
 this time. By 2010, conventional human capital variables taken together explained little of the gender wage gap, while gender differences in occupation and industry continued to be important. Moreover, the
 gender pay gap declined much more slowly at the top of the wage distribution than at the middle or bottom and by 2010 was noticeably higher at the top. We then survey the literature to identify what has been
 learned about the explanations for the gap. We conclude that many of the traditional explanations continue to have salience. Although human-capital factors are now relatively unimportant in the aggregate,
 women's work force interruptions and shorter hours remain significant in high-skilled occupations, possibly due to compensating differentials. Gender differences in occupations and industries, as well as
 differences in gender roles and the gender division of labor remain important, and research based on experimental evidence strongly suggests that discrimination cannot be discounted. Psychological attributes
 or noncognitive skills comprise one of the newer explanations for gender differences in outcomes. Our effort to assess the quantitative evidence on the importance of these factors suggests that they account for
 a small to moderate portion of the gender pay gap, considerably smaller than, say, occupation and industry effects, though they appear to modestly contribute to these differences.},

We define four specific criteria that must be met to conclude that a glass ceiling exists. Using random effects models and data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics, we examine gender and race inequalities at the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles of white male earnings. We find evidence of a glass ceiling for women, but racial inequalities among men do not follow a similar pattern. Thus, we should not describe all systems of differential work rewards as "glass ceilings." They appear to be a distinctively gender phenomenon.},

One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other consequences are that it is more difficult for women to become leaders and to achieve success in leadership roles. Evidence from varied research paradigms substantiates that these consequences occur, especially in situations that heighten perceptions of incongruity between the female gender role and leadership roles.

In this paper, we develop a framework to demonstrate how the temporal dynamics of the embedding helps to quantify changes in stereotypes and attitudes toward women and ethnic minorities in the 20th and 21st centuries in the United States. We integrate word embeddings trained on 100 y of text data with the {US} Census to show that changes in the embedding track closely with demographic and occupation shifts over time. The embedding captures societal shifts—e.g., the women’s movement in the 1960s and Asian immigration into the United States—and also illuminates how specific adjectives and occupations became more closely associated with certain populations over time. Our framework for temporal analysis of word embedding opens up a fruitful intersection between machine learning and quantitative social science.},

We also ask whether women are distinctive—does having more women in office make a difference to public policy? Throughout the review we demonstrate that a full understanding of women\&apos;s political representation requires both deep knowledge of individual cases such as the United States and broad knowledge comparing women\&apos;s participation across countries. We end with four recommended directions for future research: (a) globalizing theory and research, (b) expanding data collection, (c) remembering alternative forms of women\&apos;s agency, and (d) addressing intersectionality.},

Results show individuals depicted in intellectually focused occupations had higher face-to-body ratios than individuals depicted in physically focused occupations. Gender differences in facial prominence did not reach significance. A gender by occupation interaction indicated men in intellectually focused occupations had higher face-to-body ratios than women in similar professions, whereas women in physical occupations had higher face-to-body ratios than men in similar occupations. This suggests a disparity in the media with regard to displaying men and women equally in similar occupational roles.},

	abstract = {In this introduction to a larger edited volume, Tuchman surveys the substantive content of the mass media—television, newspapers, magazines—and the advertising they carry to gather support for her argument that, by largely ignoring women or portraying them in stereotypical roles of victim and/or consumer, the mass media symbolically annihilate women. Tuchman notes that most media portray women, if at all, in traditional roles: homemaker, mother, or, if they are in the paid workforce, clerical and other “pink-collar” jobs. Correspondingly, there are few, if any, depictions of strong female characters in positions of responsibility or authority, even inside the home. Similarly, women’s magazines focus on the “domestic” pursuits—marriage, child rearing, and the like—while not encouraging education, training, and other choices that tend to bring individuals into positions of power, authority, and independence. Instead, women generally are shown to be defined in terms of their relationships with men—suggesting that women are, in the end, dependent, incapable of living their own lives without male “guidance.”},

Blumer states that symbolic interactionism rests on three premises: that human beings act toward things on the basis of the meanings of things have for them; that the meaning of such things derives from the social interaction one has with one's fellows; and that these meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process.},

It shows that the 1960s generation of women artists emerged from the disruption of the traditional gender order in the Stalinist era. In contrast, the generation of women artists who entered the art scene in the 1980s was disadvantaged by the declining power of art institutional structures and the growing importance of informal networks for career success in late socialism. Their lack of social capital, combined with the re-emergence of macho culture in the 1980s art scene, the persistence of traditional gender roles in the home, and the loss of more substantial state support for artistic production after 1989, led to their “invisible” role in the post-1989 art world.},

This article illustrates how automated computational methods may be used in this context to scale up such empirical observations and increase their resolution and significance. We specifically apply a face and gender detection algorithm on a broad set of popular movies spanning more than three decades to carry out a large-scale appraisal of the on-screen presence of women and men. Beyond the confirmation of a strong under-representation of women, we exhibit a clear temporal trend towards fairer representativeness. We further contrast our findings with respect to a movie genre, budget, and various audience-related features such as movie gross and user ratings. We lastly propose a fine description of significant asymmetries in the mise-en-scène and mise-en-cadre of characters in relation to their gender and the spatial composition of a given frame.},
