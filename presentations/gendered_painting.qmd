## Roadmap

RQ: How are genders depicted in paintings through the history?

1.  Theoretical Background

2.  Data & Methods

3.  Results: Tracing Gender Disparities in Paintings

4.  Discussion & Conclusion

# Theoretical Background

## Cultures Reinforce Inequality

-   [**Sociological theories**]{.alert} long argued the cultural
    inequality

    -   @goffmanGenderAdvertisements1979
    -   @bourdieuDistinctionSocialCritique1984
    -   @lamontWhatMissingCultural2014

-   [**Feminist art historical studies**]{.alert} observed gender
    inequality in cultures

    -   @mulveyVisualPleasureNarrative1975
    -   @nochlinWomenArtPower1989

-   Findings in [**Computational Text Analyses**]{.alert}

    -   @gargWordEmbeddingsQuantify2018
    -   @charlesworthHistoricalRepresentationsSocial2022

## Yet, Results in Visual Materials are Controversial...

## Distinguishing Two Dimensions of Cultural Inequality

The major gap between the two papers is how they approach "inequality".

. . .

|           | Frequency-based Inequality | Feature-based Inequality  |
|:----------|:--------------------------:|:-------------------------:|
| **Text**  |        Word Counts         |      Word Embeddings      |
| **Image** |  [Figure Counts]{.alert}| [Figure Features]{.alert}  |
||[@adukiaWhatWeTeach2023]|[@guilbeaultOnlineImagesAmplify2024]|

. . .

By analyzing both dimensions upon painting, a visual culture format with
deliberation [@bergerWaysSeeing1972] and long history
[@aubertPleistoceneCaveArt2014] visual art format, this research would
like to **systematically examine the gender inequality in visual
cultures**.

## Hypotheses: Gender Disparity in Paintings

. . .

__H1__: Female characters appear less frequently in paintings than male.

. . .

- Two Conflicted Theories
    -   From advertisements [@goffmanGenderAdvertisements1979]: Female figures are
    more [tiny]{.alert}, [avoidant]{.alert} to the camera sights, and
    [leaning]{.alert}, than male figures, similar to the idea of "the
    second sex" [@beauvoirSecondSex2012].
    -   From movies [@mulveyVisualPleasureNarrative1975]: Female figures are
    more [objectified]{.alert}, thus more [large]{.alert} and
    [frontal]{.alert} towards the audience, than male figures, as so-called "male gaze".


## Hypotheses: Gender Disparity in Paintings

__H1__: Female characters appear less frequently in paintings than male.

. . .

__H2__: Sizes of different genders in paintings are different.

     H2.A: Female characters in the paintings are larger than male characters in sizes.

     H2.B: Female characters in the paintings are smaller than male characters in sizes.

. . .

__H3__: Postures of different genders in paintings are different.

     H2.A: Female characters in the paintings are more oblique than male characters.

     H2.B: Female characters in the paintings are more frontal than male characters.

. . . 

__H4__: Marginalized artists will depict female and male characters in a more equal manner, compared to the artists from dominant groups.

# Data & Methods

## WikiArt.org Dataset

## Artwork Information: Face Detection

## Artist Information: LLM Extraction

## Regressions: Fixed Effect on Face Counts

1. Baseline Model:
<div style="font-size:0.7em; text-align:center;">
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1\, \text{FaceGender}_{ij} + \beta_2\, \text{ArtistInfo}_{j} + \sum_{t=1}^{T}\beta_t\, \text{Period}_{ij} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \gamma_k\, D_{k,j} + \epsilon_{ij}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>

. . .

2. Period-interacted Model:
<div style="font-size:0.7em; text-align:center;">
$$
\begin{aligned}
Y_{ij} =\; & \beta_0 + \beta_1'\, \text{FaceGender}_{ij} + \beta_2'\, \text{ArtistInfo}_{j} + \sum_{t=1}^{T}\beta_t'\, \text{Period}_{ij}  \notag \\
    & + \sum_{t=1}^{T}\beta_{t1}'\, \text{Period}_{ij} \times \text{FaceGender}_{ij} + \sum_{k=1}^{K} \gamma_k'\, D_{k,j}' + \epsilon_{ij}'
    \label{eq:inter1}
\end{aligned}
$$
</div>


# Results

## Frequency-based Gender Disparities

![](img/2_FemalePropTrend.png)

## Feature-based Gender Disparities: Baseline

::::: columns
::: {.column width="65%"}
![](img/5_1_CoefPlot.png)

:::
::: {.column width="35%"}

Female faces are persistently [larger]{.alert} and [frontal]{.alert} than male faces in all models.

Marginalized artists hardly bridge the gender gap, while [self-taught]{.alert} artists do depict females more equally in obliqueness.
